            <h4>The Gym!</h4>
              <li>Another thing I like doing consistently is hitting the gym. It's pretty useful as a manager for stress and as a break from everything.</li>
            <h4>Cooking!</h4>
              <li>Cooking is a recently acquired skill/hobby of mine. Discovering recipes I love is a rewarding effort, and I will try to share as much as I discover on the blog.</li>
            <h4>Programming!</h4>
              <li>Although not as strong as a "hobby," I still find myself enjoying programming in its core. Such as this website, which is hosted on GitHub!</li>
            <h4>Music!</h4>
              <li>I used to be big on making my own small music jams. You can find some of them on my YouTube channel.</li>
              <li>Some of my favorite artists include Gorillaz, Men I Trust, Magdalena Bay, MGMT, Laufey, and Genesis.</li>
            <h4>Writing!</h4>
              <li>I used to write for my university's paper, The Daily Cardinal. I still keep a hoodie from them! You can find my written works since then on the blog.</li>
            <h4>Reading and Browsing!</h4>
              <li>In the time between everything above, I like to just read stuff on social media or news sites. Who doesn't?</li>
