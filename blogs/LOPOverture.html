            <h2>A Review of Lies of P: Overture</h2>
            <h4>X/XX/2025</h4>
            <img src="blogresources/LOPOverture.png" height="400" width="700">
            <p class="justalign">As a big fan of soulslikes and difficult games in general, I find it particularly interesting to find out what twists the next game puts on the genre. Many games have succeeded in that regard,
            notable standouts being Hollow Knight with its 2D Metroidvania focus and Sekiro's reinvigoration of the rigid core gameplay loop. Lies of P was always a game that stood out like a sore thumb to me because
            it successfully marks the cumulation of the genre up to its point of release, from its Belle Epoque aesthetic that is reminiscent of Bloodborne to its unforgiving combat system derived from the souls games
            of old. Even in the opening moments, it becomes very clear that this game is a hallmark title for soulslikes, one that they must envy and take inspiration from in order for the entire genre to flourish.</p>
            
            <p class="justalign">Lies of P successfully navigates its masterful art direction and foreboding atmosphere with customizable and engaging combat, cementing itself as one of the greatest soulslikes to 
            come out this decade. This opinion was only further elevated by the shadow drop of the DLC, Lies of P: Overture, which serves as a critical point of clarity in the narrative as well as building upon an already complete
            gameplay loop by introducing even more vivid areas to explore and challenges to conquer. In this review, I hope to explore why Lies of P and its DLC is an incredible, unmissable experience for those who appreciate
            a challenge.</p>

            <h4 class="justalign">A World of Machines and Monsters</h4>
    
            <h4 class="justalign">Deflect, Dodge, Die, Repeat</h4>

            <h4 class="justalign">The Grand Overture</h4>

                <p class="justalign">The introduction of the DLC is significant for the narrative of Lies of P. Taking place in Krat before its collapse, the player gets a clear cut view of how the city fell by encountering
                new and incredibly dangerous enemies almost immediately. Seriously, the new additions are no joke; they do a lot of damage and have complex movesets that can very well take many attempts to truly master. To that end,
                the increased difficulty of regular enemies presents a unique challenge unlike most of the content in the base game. This challenge, much like before, is complemented by the introduction of new weapons and tools for the player
                to master on their journey through the past. Between the first pure ranged weapon in the game to a literal gunblade, it becomes apparent that Overture arms you with the tools to succeed, but leaves success entirely
                up to your skill.</p>

                <p class="justalign">As mentioned previously, the landscapes covered by Overture are a breath of fresh air from the cityscape of the base game. The player is immediately thrust into a ruined zoo, providing many 
                navigation challenges and tightrope moments with its terrain. The coastal side of Krat is a welcome addition to the landscape, with bustling mines full of puppets, a frozen seaport, and a bloody mansion giving way to
                a diverse atmosphere that works well with the ongoing story beats. Once again, Neowiz succeeds in using their environs to build a dynamic and convincing narrative.</p>

                <p class="justalign">Going into the past of Lies of P means discovering new characters and new motivations. The narrative succeeds in delivering logical reasons behind the events of the present by
                bringing in familiar faces and worthy newcomers. Even then, said newcomers are integral to both the overarching story of the universe as well as the individual origin of the player character, which
                bridges the gaps in knowledge that may have been left within the original plot. Antagonists also prove their worth in the relatively short times they are around, having somewhat complex motivations that
                both drive the player towards putting them down and satisfy them when they eventually do. In the end, Overture succeeds in reworking the existing perception of the universe while bringing in interesting
                new faces that drive both mystery and excitement. A satisfying and emotional ending to it all sates the mysteries of the experience, proving the point that actions in the past do indeed have consequences
                in the near future.</p>

                <p class="justalign">Finally, this mini-review of the DLC would not be complete without mentioning the masterclass of boss design present. Even with the first boss encountered in the experience, it becomes clear
                that Neowiz gathered feedback and made these encounters less challenging because of delayed attacks and more so because of a perceived lack of preparation. Every boss was fair in terms of mechanics, and each one rewarded
                patience and practice over everything else. The main three bosses that reward the player with extra selectable rewards were also an incredibly welcome change of pace; there are some all timers in here! The final boss especially
                proved to be a major difficulty spike and rewards those who have the patience and mastery to overcome the rest of the game, like Malenia or Radahn from Elden Ring. These challenges were both brutal to master and satisfying to overcome,
                the mark of a well-made soulslike experience.</p>
