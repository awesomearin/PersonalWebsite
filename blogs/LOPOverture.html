            <p class="justalign">As a big fan of soulslikes and difficult games in general, I find it particularly interesting to find out what twists the next game puts on the genre. Many games have succeeded in that regard,
            notable standouts being Hollow Knight with its 2D Metroidvania focus and Sekiro's reinvigoration of the rigid core gameplay loop. Lies of P was always a game that stood out like a sore thumb to me because
            it successfully marks the cumulation of the genre up to its point of release, from its Belle Epoque aesthetic that is reminiscent of Bloodborne to its unforgiving combat system derived from the souls games
            of old. Even in the opening moments, it becomes very clear that this game is a hallmark title for soulslikes, one that they must envy and take inspiration from in order for the entire genre to flourish.</p>
            
            <p class="justalign">Lies of P successfully navigates its masterful art direction and foreboding atmosphere with customizable and engaging combat, cementing itself as one of the greatest soulslikes to 
            come out this decade. This opinion was only further elevated by the shadow drop of the DLC, Lies of P: Overture, which serves as a critical point of clarity in the narrative as well as building upon an already complete
            gameplay loop by introducing even more vivid areas to explore and challenges to conquer. In this review, I hope to explore why Lies of P and its DLC is an incredible, unmissable experience for those who appreciate
            a challenge.</p>
