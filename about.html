                <p class="justalign">I'm Arin, a Computer Science and Information Science major here at the university. My favorite tech thing right now is biometrics, which is a massive step forward for cybersecurity.
                My hobbies include playing video games, going to the gym, making music, and learning new things.</p>

            </div>
            <div class = "persontext">
                <p class="justalign">I am a student in the University of Wisconsin - Madison planning to graduate by May 2027. I have previously worked on ISO migration documentation and Amazon SP API access. Programming languages that I am efficient in include
                Java, R, C, Go, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Interfaces I am familiar with include SpringBoot, ReactJS, NodeJS, Android Studio, and Visual Studio Code.</p>

            </div>
            <div class = "persontext">
                <p class="justalign">A bit more on my hobbies: my favorite among them is definitely video games, as I grew up with them to fill in all the time between. My favorite genres include platformers, metroidvanias, roguelikes, and soulslikes.
                </p>
                <p class ="justalign">I also like to cook sometimes! Some of the things that I have made are primarily chicken-based recipes such as tenders and sandwiches, but I have made some healthy desserts including a 
                protein lava cake and a pop tart.</p>
                <p class ="justalign">Going to the gym has been a recent developing interest of mine in addition to the above. Here are my PRs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bench Press: 165 lbs</li>
                    <li>Deadlift: 275 lbs</li>
                    <li>Squat: 175 lbs</li>
                    <li>Leg Press: 847 lbs</li>
                </ul>
                <p class ="justalign">Finally, I like to write. Some of my work is still present on the Daily Cardinal, where I specialized in critique for entertainment. However, I decided to move to my independent blog to write
                without fear of a word count limit or anything of the like!</p>
                <p class ="justalign">Overall, I would consider myself an aspiring student who has already had decent experience in the field, whether it be through trainee work or through personal projects.</p>
